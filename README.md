# 3tier-environemt-by-terraform
This code will deploy the three tier application environment from scratch on AWS.
The sample out of terraform plan is:
```$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
